                    <p class="text-2xl">This one-day workshop aims to map data and its inherent connections to work (of all kinds) across a landscape of ongoing crises. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners with an interest in data work that underpins automation, algorithmic systems and organizational and societal strives toward datafication. The workshop provides a forum for interdisciplinary discussions around controversies related to data and work – and data work in particular – with the aim to expand the toolbox for working with data by proposing and developing critical approaches, drawing on the rich contributions of the growing body of literature on data work and datafication. Through spatial and temporal mapping exercises, the workshop intends to both trace paths through past crises into a contemporary moment, and towards more hopeful futures.</p>

                <h2 class="font-bold text-5xl mt-16">Illustrative controversies</h2>
                <p>Rather than defining specific conference themes, we offer here some illustrative controversies for opening up the conversation. The work of the workshop will be to expand and deepen this list and produce a generative mapping, along with thinking through what we can take from the past decade of scholarship and build upon.</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-bold text-4xl mt-12">Erosion of skill and the meaning of work</h3>
                <p>Working with an expansive definition of data work as “any human activity related to creating, collecting, managing, curating, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating data” [6], we are all becoming data workers. Data-driven moves to outsource and automate work commonly lead to the transformation of work rather than machines replacing human effort [19, 26]. This raises controversy over how we might (or fail to) protect values of skill, care, and experienced meaning in work. Within the HCI/CSCW literature, there are at least four meanings of data work that are of interest for this workshop: (1) data work in pre-existing work practice that is getting datafied (e.g. [14, 19]), (2) the data work that data scientists do (and would like to avoid doing) to clean and prepare data sets (e.g. [1, 4, 20, 21]), (3) data work that is outsourced to click workers (e.g. [9, 28], and (4) data work that is delegated to algorithms (e.g. [13]).</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-bold text-4xl mt-12">Invisibility of data/work and its emotional burdens</h3>
                <p>As a related controversy, narratives of automation and datafication risk losing sight of work practice and the emotional burdens it may involve, especially when it comes to data practices like content moderation or red-teaming. Data work is often invisible, uncompensated work that disproportionately burdens those low in organizational hierarchies [3, 19]. Data work tasks are assigned to workers at all levels without attention to the labor data work requires. In the wake of Big Data and AI, research on data work has paid disproportionate attention to the practices of data scientists and data analytics [24]. However, data work entails multiple forms of labor carried out by professionals and laypeople who do data work adjacent to their core work tasks and data work professionals alike [5].</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-bold text-4xl mt-12">Inequalities around data/work</h3>
                <p>There is a need to understand how power relations surrounding data work operate at both micro as well at macro levels of scale. Research shows there are differences in global experiences of data work [12, 18, 25, 27], with data work in the global south often following the historical fault lines of colonialism [23]. Thus, there is a pressing need for interdisciplinary scholarly attention to data work that attends to power at multiple levels of analysis, from the micro (individual, organizational) to the macro (global). Moreover, these inequalities are echoed in data and their production.Data often reflect social inequalities along historical, geographical and socio-economic lines. For instance, geographies of previously colonised lands may be valued less for their use than they are valued as sites for extraction [10], with datafication reflecting economic rather than social needs. The systems and logics of datafication are imposed even in humanitarian contexts [15] and at local levels, marginalised communities may have and be given less access to data and derive less value from its political power [11].</p>
