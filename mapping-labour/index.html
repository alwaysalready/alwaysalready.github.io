                    <p>This one-day workshop invites researchers and practitioners to map the human labour, in its sites, categories, and characteristics, in the infrastructuring of AI and algorithmic systems. Our concern is with the broadening of the terms with which we articulate and account for human labour in the AI pipeline. We aim to attend to not only the privileged bodies in the production of AI or the harmed bodies in the witnessing and moderation of its harms, but the constellation of mundane labours that make AI systems work the way they work. We consider this labour across sites – from labelling datasets, to red teaming, to the (inevitable) public perception management – and across categories of work – from knowledge work to emotion work, from bodily work to organisational work. Approaching the AI pipeline both as a site of empirical study and critical scrutiny, this workshop promotes a CSCW perspective into the inquiry of the humans, work practices, and politics in the AI pipeline. Taking a reflective turn, the workshop also invites us to consider what we as CSCW researchers – one group of humans active at various parts of the AI pipeline – can do and be challenged by through engaging with AI production.

                    <p>The workshop is an open invitation for researchers and practitioners to develop our shared account of human labour in the production of AI and algorithmic systems. We encourage broad considerations of this topic, and offer some pressing challenges to begin the conversation. We open discussions for studies on the mundane work of AI, the sites at and through which this work takes place, how we account for this work in its categories, characteristics, and scalar and connective production of the pipeline.

                <div class="text-sm space-y-3">
                    <p>This workshop seeks to address the work that makes AI systems work, with the goal of articulating the human labour that creates, maintains, and sometimes breaks these systems. It is a longstanding tradition within CSCW (cf. [19, 24] to account for the politics of visible and invisible work as well as the consequences for the representations of people within socio-technical systems design. Across various systems, including the world wide web, digital libraries, call centres, online discussion fora, food delivery services, and social media, CSCW has attended to who is entangled in making technologies work. This workshop welcomes discussion of what workplace studies of the AI pipeline do or could look like, and what can be gained by approaching the AI pipeline from a practice-based research orientation [3].</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg pt-4">Sites of human labour in the pipeline</h3>
                <div class="text-sm space-y-3">
                    <p>A starting point for this workshop will be a mapping of the work across the AI pipeline. The different forms of labour – and values associated with this work – will be captured, with emphasis on the ways these centre agency, power and authority in AI imaginaries. This mapping will cut across the data work needed to build training datasets and fine-tune models (often outsourced to the global south) [5, 6, 12, 16, 17], to the labours involved in building and designing tools and systems [13, 27], and the much valorised work done to develop AI models and algorithms [14]. This workshop will invite discussions on where these forms of work are done, spatially and geographically, and how a logic used to breakdown the pipeline celebrates some forms of labour and devalues others.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg pt-4">Categories and characteristics of human labour in the pipeline</h3>
                <div class="text-sm space-y-3">
                    <p>The grand narrative of AI sits within the tension of technocratic logics and the shepherding of the magical black box [10]. Through technocratic framings and wizardary the human labour of, for in- stance, working through messy datasets becomes the costless, abstract and logical counting work [6] of sanitisation in data cleaning, while the work of piecing together and fabricating datasets gets rendered as effortless but valuable data enrichment. These categories of work are sequential, smooth, and as such often rendered invisible. Alternative categories of work – whether it is emotion work, body work, ethical work – offer us new ways to approach how we orientate to the AI pipeline. For instance, understood as matters of care [20], datasets and the people who produce them [22] challenges the work that is, or is not, drawn into consideration of the AI pipeline. It extends how we map human labour in its character and scope – what we do and how we do it – and both in work that is sited and in work across the pipeline, it asks what are the consequences of our stories of the AI pipeline? The means through which we can account for it as/to matter..</p>
                    <p>One example of such a category is to consider that human labour of AI and algorithmic systems can be understood to involve forms of emotional labour and emotion work – distinguished often only by whether one is paid for it or not [2]. In both cases, professionals working in the AI pipeline engage in work to utilise and regulate their own and others’ emotions. Concerns for the emotional cost of work have been raised for the human labour in AI pipeline, particularly for those working with content moderation [22, 25]. Moderators, confronted with only the materials deemed harmful, experience mental and emotional fatigue, even over the course of a work day, directly impacting decisions made on data and content in the pipeline.</p>
                
                </div>
                
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg pt-4">Scale and AI’s global supply chain</h3>
                <div class="text-sm space-y-3">
                    <p>Another cut to be made in considering the AI pipeline and thinking across the labours that sustain AI is through the webs and weaves of scale. Attending to scale, this workshop will invite a standing back to ask how CSCW might offer a productive analytical frame to examine the many and varied labours making up a global supply chain. Think here about the uneven and woven-together scales through which AI systems are developed and then operate. There are, for example, the many different settings and geographies in which people are needed to make OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4.O speak and translate multiple languages [9], or ensure a car stops before striking a pedestrian [4], or allows checkout tills to be removed from supermarkets [8]. Across such scales, labours are of course local and contingent, yet at the same time they flow into and sustain vast global networks.</p>
                    <p>Reflections on scale also raise questions about the political and economic flows that AI operates through and across. The pipeline – as it is often conceived – masks the patchiness of labour and the prevailing political economy, namely late capitalism, that labour operates in relation to. Unsurprisingly, alternative and discounted categories of work and labour are found to sit awkwardly against the scalar logics that drive capitalist ruins [26]. Here, then, the workshop will use scale as a means of situating labours in worlds that are politically and economically organised. Again, the invitation will be to consider what orientations CSCW does (and doesn’t) have to make sense of human labour in the AI pipeline in these scalar terms.</p>
