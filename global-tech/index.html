                    <p>The remarkable capacities of AI-infused and data intensive systems are regularly presented as emblematic of technoscientific innovation and progress. Far less recognised is the human labour required to sift through and sort data, and
                        ultimately train these systems. This is a labour distributed well beyond the presumed centres of technological innovation, and spun into and strewn across geographically distributed regions in the "Global South". This workshop
                        will bring together scholars and practitioners interested in and conducting research on the hidden labours that lie behind AI and data intensive systems. Participants will have the opportunity to share perspectives or results of
                        their research and, through highly exploratory engagements and dialogues, set out a critical mode of inquiry and future directions with and for a nascent community.</p>
