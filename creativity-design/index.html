					Overview
				</h2>
				<p>
					This module will give students the opportunity to think creatively about user experience and interaction design. Central to the module will be learning to apply a range of tools, techniques and methods. Through short lectures, and hands-on tutorials and practicals, you’ll be encouraged to foster creative impulses and open up spaces for creativity in design.
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout the module, you will be responding to a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_brief">design brief</a>". The brief will invite opportunities to explore and design a proposal or intervention for the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city">Smart City</a>". You’ll work in groups of 4-5 students over the term to both learn a range of design techniques and methods, and use these in your design practice.

				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The challenge will be to imaginatively combine a range of tools, techniques and methods to respond creatively to the design brief and think critically and reflectively about your practice.

					Goals/Learning Outcomes
				</h2>
				<p>
					There will be five key areas of learning:
				</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col s12">
						<p>
							<em>1. Core skills</em><br />
							Developing core skills using a range of creative tools, techniques and methods, including ethnographic observation, sketching, video, Arduino, etc.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col s12">
						<p>
							<em>2. Creative impulse</em><br />
							Developing a creative impulse for combining these skills to think witha design ‘problem’ and to see things differently, so as to imagine new and alternative forms of interaction and experience.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col s12">
						<p>
							<em>3. Collaborative design</em><br />
							Understanding the dynamics of creative group work and learning how to use collaboration to approach design and innovation.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col s12">
						<p>
							<em>4. Reflective practice</em><br />
							Building and refining your individual reflective practice in order to question and think critically about your work.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col s12">
						<p>
							<em>5. The Smart City</em><br />
							Understanding multiple perspectives onto the Smart City, including the lived experience of the city, monitoring and dashboards (e.g. energy, population, transport, climate), infrastructure, finance and debt, and accessibility.
						</p>

					Assessment
				</h2>
				<p>
					The module will use work on a group project and an individual “workbook” or “sketchbook” to assess participation and learning. Both forms of assessment will be worth 50% of the final overall mark for the module.
				</p>
				<h3 class="small">
					Group project (50%)
				</h3>
				<p>
					Students will be assessed on the progress they make in their group work over the term, and the quality of their group's final design proposal/intervention. Progress will be tracked in seminars and tutorials, and during an interim “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-why-and-how-of-effective-design-critiques-944313947fe4">crit</a>” (Lecture 6). Each groups’ completed proposal/intervention will be judged in a final “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-why-and-how-of-effective-design-critiques-944313947fe4">crit</a>” (Lecture 10) by the two lecturers and a guest. The group work will be assessed against:
				</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col s12">
						<span>i. its use of the tools, techniques and methods learnt on the module;</span>
					</div>
					<div class="col s12">
						<span>ii. the demonstration of productive and creative group work;</span>
					</div>
					<div class="col s12">
						<span>iii. and what is judged to be the overall quality of the work.</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Students in each group will all receive the same mark for the group work unless there is a clear indication differences in individual contributions.
				</p>
				<h3 class="small">
					Individual workbook (50%)
				</h3>
				<p>
					Over the duration of the module, students will keep a workbook or sketchbook logging their own contributions to their group project. Students will be introduced to the idea of a workbook and invited to think creatively about how best to record their work.
