				The module specification for Creativity in Design, HCID Msc., City University of London.
			</div>
			<h2 class="flow-text">
				Overview
			</h2>
			<div class="flow-text">
				This module will give students the opportunity to think creatively about user experience and interaction design. Central to the module will be learning to apply a range of tools, techniques and methods. Through short lectures, and hands-on tutorials and practicals, you’ll be encouraged to foster creative impulses and open up spaces for creativity in design.
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
			</div>
			<div class="flow-text">
				Throughout the module, you will be responding to a "<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_brief">design brief</a></span><span>". The brief will invite opportunities to explore and design a proposal or intervention for the “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city">Smart City</a></span><span>”. You’ll work in groups of 4-5 students over the term to both learn a range of design techniques and methods, and use these in your design practice.</span>

				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
			</div>
			<div class="flow-text">
				The challenge will be to imaginatively combine a range of tools, techniques and methods to respond creatively to the design brief and think critically and reflectively about your practice.

			<h2>
				Goals/Learning Outcomes
			</h2>
			<div class="flow-text">
				There will be five key areas of learning:
			</div>
			<div>
				<br style="font-family: Courier;" />
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">1. Core skills</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">Developing core skills using a range of creative tools, techniques and methods, including ethnographic observation, sketching, video, Arduino, etc.</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<br style="font-family: Courier;" />
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">2. Creative impulse</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">Developing a creative impulse for combining these skills to think witha design ‘problem’ and to see things differently, so as to imagine new and alternative forms of interaction and experience.</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<br style="font-family: Courier;" />
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">3. Collaborative design</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">Understanding the dynamics of creative group work and learning how to use collaboration to approach design and innovation.</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<br style="font-family: Courier;" />
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">4. Reflective practice</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">Building and refining your individual reflective practice in order to question and think critically about your work.</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<br style="font-family: Courier;" />
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">5. The Smart City</span>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">Understanding multiple perspectives onto the Smart City, including the lived experience of the city, monitoring and dashboards (e.g. energy, population, transport, climate), infrastructure, finance and debt, and accessibility.</span>

				ASSESSMENT
			</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="flow-text">
			The module will use work on a group project and an individual “workbook” or “sketchbook” to assess participation and learning. Both forms of assessment will be worth 50% of the final overall mark for the module.
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<h3 class="flow-text">
			Group project (50%)
		</h3>
		<div class="flow-text">
			Students will be assessed on the progress they make in their group work over the term, and the quality of their group's final design proposal/intervention. Progress will be tracked in seminars and tutorials, and during an interim “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-why-and-how-of-effective-design-critiques-944313947fe4">crit</a>” (Lecture 6). Each groups’ completed proposal/intervention will be judged in a final “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-why-and-how-of-effective-design-critiques-944313947fe4">crit</a>” (Lecture 10) by the two lecturers and a guest. The group work will be assessed against:
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<span style="font-family: Courier;">i. its use of the tools, techniques and methods learnt on the module;</span>
		</div>
		<div>
			<span style="font-family: Courier;">ii. the demonstration of productive and creative group work;</span>
		</div>
		<div>
			<span style="font-family: Courier;">iii. and what is judged to be the overall quality of the work.</span>
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div class="flow-text">
			Students in each group will all receive the same mark for the group work unless there is a clear indication differences in individual contributions.
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<h3 class="flow-text">
			Individual workbook (50%)
		</h3>
		<div class="flow-text">
			Over the duration of the module, students will keep a workbook or sketchbook logging their own contributions to their group project. Students will be introduced to the idea of a workbook and invited to think creatively about how best to record their work.
