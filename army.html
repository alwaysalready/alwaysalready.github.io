					Army - "When the laborers’ arms become tools in the creation of wealth, the laborers lose their arms. To become his arm is to lose your arm. The factory owner does not only acquire the laborers’ arms; he has his own arms freed. We can hear another sense in which arms are striking. To go on strike is to clench your fist, to refuse to be handy. When workers refuse to allow their arms to be the master’s tool, they strike. The clenched fist remains a revolutionary sign for labor movements, internationally. — Sara Ahmed. Living a Feminist Life.

					Multiscalar methods - When confronted by logics and regimes that risk up-scaling---seeking the universal in order to grow, in place of local and indigenous scales---we need better tools to build in the scales of the marginalized or erased in our research and development. We might ask, as historian Gabrielle Hecht does: "What happens when we treat empirical objects as interscalar vehicles, as means of connecting stories and scales usually kept apart?". Similarly, it means drawing on feminist and postcolonial scholars like Hartman and Lowe who read and write across and between archives. Their ideas suggest not scaling upwards, moving vertically, but rather through and across, to weave together meanings and build new ways to think. This might mean working the scales of time and place of being Black American into and against "regeneration" projects in Seattle, as above, or putting the scales of the local rural and agricultural communities in full-conversation with the technopolitical smart city projects throughout the global south (e.g., Datta 2015).

					Solidarity - We propose  to follow from Mohanty's now resolute cry for a solidarity in resistance. This is a solidarity that doesn't overwrite difference, but that attends to and is responsive to "historical and experiential specificities" (Mhanty 2003). It is a recognition of the tensions and commonalities of difference across varied scales, and what these differentiated conditions allow for in making more possible. A multiscalar project means we in HCI must collectively work on strategies for becoming with the people and places we design for, not applying the scales of "up close" or "at a distance", but being in it together and being awakened by the contrasts and tensions in scalings.
